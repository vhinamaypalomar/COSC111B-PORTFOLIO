# Laboratory Activity 4 – Arduino Serial Communication

## Objectives
- Utilize and familiarize students on different basic Serial connection functions.
- Create a simple circuit that can be controlled using Serial connection.

## Description
This activity combines sensor automation with Serial communication. LED blinking is triggered by a brightness threshold and can be stopped using a Serial command.

## What Was Implemented
- Photoresistor-based brightness detection
- LED blinking behavior
- Serial command handling

## Code Summary
- Initializes Serial communication at 9600 baud
- Sends sensor readings to the Serial Monitor
- Reads text-based Serial commands
- Allows user input to override automated behavior
