---

### Laboratory Activity #2: Analog Signals and Analog-to-Digital Conversion
**Objectives**  
Implement analog signal processing in Arduino circuits and understand analog-to-digital signal conversion using the `map()` function.

---

### Laboratory Activity #3: Fire Sensor Implementation
**Objectives**  
Design and implement a fire detection system using a thermistor and photoresistor, with alert mechanisms through LEDs and an optional buzzer when threshold values are exceeded.

---

### Laboratory Activity #4: Arduino Serial Communication
**Objectives**  
Implement Arduino serial communication, utilize fundamental serial functions, and control a simple circuit through serial input.

---

### Laboratory Activity #5: Receiving Serial Communication from Python
**Objectives**  
Establish serial communication between Arduino and Python, process incoming serial data using Python, and control an Arduino circuit through Python-based commands.

---

### Laboratory Activity #6: Bidirectional Control Using Arduino and Python
**Objectives**  
Implement bidirectional serial communication between Arduino and Python to enable data exchange, system feedback, and hardware control.

---

### Laboratory Activity #7: Controlling Arduino Using FastAPI
**Objectives**  
Integrate Arduino with Python through serial communication and implement HTTP-based control using FastAPI to enable bidirectional system interaction.

## Practical Examinations

### Midterm Practical Examination: Smart Lighting System
**Objectives**  
Design and implement a smart lighting system using Arduino and a photoresistor, convert sensor readings into percentage-based values, control LED indicators using defined thresholds, implement manual and automatic modes, and display system status via serial communication.
