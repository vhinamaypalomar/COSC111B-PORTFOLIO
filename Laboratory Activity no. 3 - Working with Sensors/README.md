# Laboratory Activity 3 – Working with Sensors

## Objectives
- Implement a fire sensor using a thermistor and photoresistor. 
- Alerts via LED and optional buzzer when thresholds are exceeded.

## Description
A basic fire detection system is created using temperature and light sensors. An LED and buzzer activate when both environmental conditions indicate a potential fire hazard.

## What Was Implemented
- Thermistor for temperature sensing
- Photoresistor for light intensity detection
- LED and buzzer alert system

## Code Summary
- Converts thermistor readings to Celsius using a logarithmic formula
- Reads brightness levels from a photoresistor
- Compares sensor values against defined thresholds
- Activates alert outputs when unsafe conditions are detected
